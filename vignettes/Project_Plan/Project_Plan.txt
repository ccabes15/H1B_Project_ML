Project Title:

Remaining Useful Life Prediction Using Machine Learning Methods

Group Members:

Yuka Chen
Jeremy Joy
Concillia Mpofu
Connor Cabrey

Topic: Using the NASA PHM08 Challenge Dataset, our group will attempt to predict the remaining useful life of engines with multiple Machine Learning methods
and approaches.

Questions of Interest: At least two involving different variables used for regression or classification.

1) What variables of the 26 most contribute to the Remaining Useful Life of the engines?
2) Which machine learning method most accurately predicts RUL?
3) What variables can be removed to speed up prediction of RUL?

Approaches:

Multiple Regression
Ridge Regression
Clustering
Jackknife for cross-validation
Principal Component Analysis


Group Responsibilities:

Connor - Identify Data Source
	 - Data upload and cleaning
	 - Initial EDA
	 - Clustering
	 - Poster Layout
Connie - Multiple Regression
	 - EXSUM
Jeremy - Ridge Regression
	 - PCA
	 - Ethical Assessment/Stakeholders
Yuka	 - Jackknife/PCA
	 - Project Compilation

Deliverable: Our group will do Option A: Presentation or Poster.  We will be creating a presentation.
